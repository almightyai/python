Chapter: "Working with Databases"

In this chapter, we will delve into the realm of databases and explore how Python can seamlessly interact with different types of databases. 

Firstly, we will introduce you to SQL databases in Python, including popular options such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy. You will learn how to connect to databases, execute queries, and handle data retrieval and manipulation. Understanding how to effectively work with SQL databases is essential for web developers as it forms the backbone of many web applications.

Next, we will shift our focus to NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB, and its integration with Python. NoSQL databases have gained popularity due to their flexibility and scalability, and you will discover how to leverage MongoDB's Python integration to interact with document-oriented databases. This section will equip you with the skills required to work with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

Lastly, we will explore the concept of database migrations using Alembic and Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). Database migrations are crucial for managing changes to a database schema over time, especially in a development workflow with multiple contributors. By understanding and implementing database migrations, you will ensure the smooth evolution of your database schemas while preserving data integrity.

Understanding how to work with databases is fundamental to building robust web applications. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of different types of databases, their integration with Python, and the tools available for managing database schemas effectively.
