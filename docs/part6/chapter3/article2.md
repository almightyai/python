# Using the `re` Module: `search`, `match`, `findall`, and `sub`

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides a wide range of functions and methods for working with regular expressions. In this chapter, we will explore four commonly used methods: `search`, `match`, `findall`, and `sub`. Understanding these methods and how to use them effectively is essential for everyday coding in Python.

## Importance of Regular Expressions in Everyday Coding

Regular expressions are extensively used in various programming tasks, making them an indispensable tool for developers. Whether it's data parsing, string manipulation, input validation, or text pattern matching, regular expressions offer a flexible and efficient solution. Their ability to search, match, and replace strings based on complex patterns makes them invaluable in everyday coding scenarios.

By mastering the `re` module's methods, you can greatly enhance your productivity as a Python developer. With regular expressions, you can efficiently extract data from unstructured text, validate user input, perform advanced search and replace operations, and much more. Now, let's dive into the four key methods provided by the `re` module.

## `search`: Finding the First Occurrence of a Pattern

The `search` method allows you to search for a pattern or regular expression within a given string. It returns a match object if the pattern is found, otherwise it returns `None`. One of the main advantages of `search` is that it finds the first occurrence of the pattern.

Let's say you have a log file and you want to extract the first occurrence of a specific error message. Using `search`, you can easily accomplish this:

```python
import re

log_message = "Error: File not found in line 10"
pattern = r"Error: (\w+)"
match = re.search(pattern, log_message)
if match:
    error_type = match.group(1)
    print(f"Found error: {error_type}")
```

In this example, the regular expression pattern `r"Error: (\w+)"` captures the type of error. The `search` method returns a match object, which we can use to extract the error type using `match.group(1)`. By focusing on practical examples like extracting error messages from log files, you can better understand how to utilize regular expressions in real-world scenarios.

## `match`: Matching Patterns at the Beginning of a String

The `match` method is similar to `search`, but it specifically matches patterns at the beginning of a string. It searches for the pattern from the start of the string and returns a match object if the pattern is found, otherwise it returns `None`. This method is useful when you need to determine if a string starts with a specific pattern.

Consider a scenario where you want to match all the lines in a file that start with the word "Important". Here's how you can achieve this using `match`:

```python
import re

file_content = """
Important: This is a critical message.
This line is not important.
Important: Please take immediate action.
"""

lines = file_content.split("\n")
pattern = r"^Important: (.+)$"
for line in lines:
    match = re.match(pattern, line)
    if match:
        print(f"Important message: {match.group(1)}")
```

In this example, the regular expression `r"^Important: (.+)$"` checks if a line starts with "Important" and captures the rest of the line. The `match` method allows us to filter out and process only those lines that match our criteria.

## `findall`: Finding All Occurrences of a Pattern

The `findall` method is used to find all occurrences of a pattern within a string. It returns a list of all matching substrings. This method is particularly handy when you want to extract multiple instances of a pattern from a text.

To illustrate this, let's suppose you have a text file containing multiple email addresses and you want to extract all of them. Here's how you can accomplish this using `findall`:

```python
import re

text = "Email addresses: john@example.com, jane@example.com, mary@example.com"
pattern = r"\b\w+@\w+\.\w+\b"
email_addresses = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Found email addresses:")
for address in email_addresses:
    print(address)
```

In this example, the regular expression `r"\b\w+@\w+\.\w+\b"` matches email addresses. The `findall` method returns a list of all email addresses found in the text. By using practical examples like this, you can gain a better understanding of how regular expressions can be applied to solve real-world problems.

## `sub`: Replacing Patterns in a String

The `sub` method is used to replace occurrences of a pattern with a specified string. It searches for the pattern in a string and replaces all matches with the provided replacement string.

Let's imagine you have a CSV file with dates in the format "MM/DD/YYYY", and you want to convert them to the format "YYYY-MM-DD". Here's how you can achieve this using `sub`:

```python
import re

csv_data = "Name,Joining Date\nJohn,10/15/2020\nJane,12/01/2019"
pattern = r"(\d{2})/(\d{2})/(\d{4})"
reformatted_data = re.sub(pattern, r"\3-\1-\2", csv_data)
print(reformatted_data)
```

In this example, the regular expression pattern `r"(\d{2})/(\d{2})/(\d{4})"` matches dates in the format "MM/DD/YYYY". The `sub` method replaces each match with the reordered date format "YYYY-MM-DD". The resulting string is stored in `reformatted_data`. Real-world examples like this can help you understand how to use regular expressions for advanced text manipulation tasks.

## Conclusion

The `re` module in Python provides powerful methods for pattern matching and text manipulation using regular expressions. In this article, we explored `search`, `match`, `findall`, and `sub`, which are essential methods for everyday coding. By examining practical examples, we have discussed how to leverage these methods in real-world scenarios, allowing you to efficiently solve various programming tasks. With a solid understanding of the `re` module, you can greatly expand your coding capabilities and make your Python programs more robust and efficient.
